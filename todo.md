# TODOs

- Keep two framebuffers - draw to one while reading from the other in order to not show the drawing happening on screen
- Implement a simple cpu on board, that can access uart to be programmed, and then execute software, it needs to be able to run the original DOOM
- Expand color to 24 bit - since this cannot fit into bram, move framebuffer to memory, and read row by row
