# TODOs

- Fix the timing issue when reading from framebuffer - buffer the next pixel at every pixel clock
- Keep two framebuffers - draw to one while reading from the other in order to not show the drawing happening on screen
- We need the instruction engine to have a proper pipeline so we don't waste most our clocks
